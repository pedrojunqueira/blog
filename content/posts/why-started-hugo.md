This is the second attempt I started a blog and this time is different.

I once had a blog that was not about data science but I was able to write over 150 blog posts and I had a decent readership and people following it and even launched a paid [e-book](http://www.velaepavio.com/produtos/landing-page/) that gave me some money. Not enough for me to do it full time but it was very encouraging and it kept me motivated to keep me writing.

The [blog](www.velaepavio.com) is still up but I have not written on it since 2016 when I finally abandoned it. The blog was about trading, more specifically about trading systems. I did not know but, what I was actually doing, was data science.
I completely lost interest in the subject that I once was passionate about. I read a lot of books and was trying out different things but then for some reason this fizzle out and it died.

What I realized is that I loved the analysis and writing and testing the systems, and simulating but I just could not trade and gamble my money.

Eventually I got into data science and also am excited about it and reading and studying tonnes and learning, but I have not been writing and sharing much about it.

About a year ago, or a bit more, I started a new blog and attempt to start writing about data science and sharing my learning. I confess that it was a complete failure.

I wrote 13 posts so far. This is 1 post a month on average. This is just not good. I think a good average to build significant content and get the momentum going is about 1 or more post a week. That is about 50 posts per year and over the years this compounds. If I can keep up with it in 3 years I would have 150 posts. In this very example I would be about ~ 50 posts already.

The reason I failed was that I was not consistent and I was just not disciplined enough and this is the difference from the previous blog. I had the discipline to write almost every day even if I was not filling like.

With this blog, I made the commitment to wake up and write for 30 minutes no matter what and then edit the content to be published at least once a week.

Back to the topic of my post is if I already have a [blog](http://petodata.space/) with 13 posts why I am starting a new one?

This is an excellent point and the reason is because I wanted to do everything from my text editor and the CLI as I am getting more into software development. Before I was using Word Press, which I think is a great platform.

However, Hugo is pushing me to learn new things, get comfortable with CLI and also teaching me markdown syntax and probably will eventually push me to learn golang. üññüèª
