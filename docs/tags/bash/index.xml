      <description>Using the command line interface (CLI) can be very intimidating and make one completely lost if you always dealt with graphical drag and drop, click and point interface.
I grew up in the 80s and my first interactions with computer was always through CLI and remember that the 2 first commands I learned were then cls for clear the screen and dir to list the files in the current directory. Even applications like word for MS-DOS was all text and there was no mouse then.</description>
