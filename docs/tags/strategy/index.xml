      <description>Data Governance is an essential topic for enterprises. Although leadership talks about and wants to implement it, attempts to do so have often failed. In this post, I will discuss why this is and what needs to change to make Data Governance work.

      <description>What business admit that is not driven by data?
Even if some argue that most of the business make decisions on intuition at least some understanding of the data is needed such as how much is in the bank, what is the sales ytd, how many staff there are in the books, are we meeting budget.
No one just make decisions on a whim and in my view to some degree all companies are data driven.</description>
