      <description>Yesterday I published a post on and shared on LinkedIn and had a quite big reaction as an popular PBI influencer commented on my post.
One of the comments by Jesus Jayaro called my attention saying that if pyodbc is used with execute many it is faster than data factory.
So I did a quick research and in reality it is fast I am impressed.
On my quick research I could put together a working script.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote blog post about how to connect pandas to your SQL database and read file from SQL server.
pandas is a fantastic tool to analyse and manipulate data. I use it all the time. It is very efficient if the &amp;ldquo;size&amp;rdquo; of the data is say up to 1 million records and can be done in your local machine or in a VM fairly quick calculations. No problems at all.</description>

      <description>I am a cyclist enthusiast and you may be if you are reading this blog post.
Strava has a nice API which gives access to the data recorded on the application.
Strava does not make it easy for the normal human being that no nothing about coding to access the data, on the other hand it makes it amazing for someone that knows code and is a developer. The API, which stands for Application Programming Interface allows to interact with Strava application and do lots of operations like extract data and also post, if enough permission is given by the user.</description>
