      <title>Why I stopped using Stack Overflow</title>

      <description>Stack Overflow is great and it saved me many times. I only use it to read and usually do not ask questions and do not contribute. Despite been great for me I had a bad experience dealing with a person. I once asked a question and all that I got was a down vote, which is bad to your &amp;ldquo;points&amp;rdquo; in the community.
The reason is that the question was answered already somewhere in different words and because of this trauma I never asked a question again and any question I ever asked after that has already been answered somehow somewhere in the internet and Google was my best friend for this.</description>

      <description>According to the World Economic Forum Report data scientist is one of the most sought after professional and on the rise in 2020/2021 and it will be for a while.
In 2012 when Harvard Business Review published the article as the most sexy profession it is strange someone saying that does not want to be a data scientist?
Why not if it is so hot and so cool and it pays so much?</description>
