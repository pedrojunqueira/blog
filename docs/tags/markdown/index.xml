      <description>This is the second attempt I started a blog and this time is different.
I once had a blog that was not about data science but I was able to write over 150 blog posts and I had a decent readership and people following it and even launched a paid e-book that gave me some money. Not enough for me to do it full time but it was very encouraging and it kept me motivated to keep me writing.</description>
