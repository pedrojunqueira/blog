      <title>Why I stopped using Stack Overflow</title>

      <description>Stack Overflow is great and it saved me many times. I only use it to read and usually do not ask questions and do not contribute. Despite been great for me I had a bad experience dealing with a person. I once asked a question and all that I got was a down vote, which is bad to your &amp;ldquo;points&amp;rdquo; in the community.
The reason is that the question was answered already somewhere in different words and because of this trauma I never asked a question again and any question I ever asked after that has already been answered somehow somewhere in the internet and Google was my best friend for this.</description>

      <title>Understand how objects behave in memory Python</title>

      <description>Sometimes debugging take more time than you are willing to spend on it. Usually you do not want to waste any time debugging but the life of a software developer is debugging all the time.
I came across a interesting one.
I often see mini examples on twitter about a code snippet of how objects behave in Python and some unintended consequences may cause your code to do things you were not expecting, yet it totally makes sense.</description>

      <title>Connect Python Azure SQL DB using Pandas</title>

      <description>The other day I wanted to connect pandas to Azure SQL DB and boy took me longer than I wanted. In the end I solved my problem. Although, connecting to DBs always involves more complex things like DB drives and OS dependencies the part I struggled the most was with the connection string ðŸ˜…. Microsoft, in its documentation, which by the way is good, gives good example and steps on setting up the environnement and how to connect through pyodbc.</description>

      <title>Python property class and decorator</title>

      <description>About 2 months ago I considered my self an intermediate python user.
This level of knowledge was enough to work on pandas data transformation and use most of the data science API.
However, when it comes to software engineering and developing production, tested code I realized that there was a lot to learn about programming concepts and how that would work with python.
My intermediate knowledge and experience already gave me lots of power but when I started to dig into source code and also at work when I had to browse to some large code base I felt that I did not know lots of things in python and had to get my s*** together and become a proficient advanced and fluent python user.</description>

      <title>Duck Typing in Python</title>

      <description>In OOP (Object Oriented Programming) there is a concept called Polymorphism which allow the use of objects of different types through a uniform interface.
Since Python allow OOP constructs Polymorphism applies.
As Python is a dynamic type language a method didnâ€™t using an interface does not need to know about about the interface type, only it&amp;rsquo;s abstract details. The interface will work just by making suer the arguments match when it is used.</description>

      <title>Python regex basics to never forget</title>

      <description>I have to confess that regex is a weakness this is why I am writing this post.
Whenever I can I try to avoid using regex if the problem can be used in a different way, but sometimes I have to inevitably use regex.
to import
import re
This is the only part that I usually remember :)
Regex are patters represented by symbols
for example
pattern = &amp;#39;a&amp;#39; test_string = &amp;#39;a cat&amp;#39; result = re.</description>

      <title>How to download data from Strava with Python</title>

      <description>I am a cyclist enthusiast and you may be if you are reading this blog post.
Strava has a nice API which gives access to the data recorded on the application.
Strava does not make it easy for the normal human being that no nothing about coding to access the data, on the other hand it makes it amazing for someone that knows code and is a developer. The API, which stands for Application Programming Interface allows to interact with Strava application and do lots of operations like extract data and also post, if enough permission is given by the user.</description>

      <title>How to get a PySpark environment running on Jupyter</title>

      <description>Python is a magical language. It is just import from * and then the magic start happening&amp;hellip;
However, not always all run smoothly. Sometimes all that you want is to run code but as part of coding debugging is a constant battle until you get your code running as you wish.
Besides the debugging, you need to set up your development environment that can be very very tedious. Sometime you just want to code and get your job done and you may spend hours and hours just setting up the environnement, importing packages, creating VMs, exporting environment variables, running shell scrips, going 10x to stack overflow and still struggle to make things work fine, then finally you can start writing some code.</description>

      <title>Best Data Science Podcasts</title>

      <description>If I am not doing an Udemy course, testing a tutorial or doing any online course in any break I get to learn as much as I can about Python, Computer Science, Software Engineering, Statistics and Data Science, I am listening to a podcast. I usually do this when I am commuting either riding my bike, on the bus or driving. A good time to listen to a podcast is when I need a break from absorbing too much content by following a course.</description>
