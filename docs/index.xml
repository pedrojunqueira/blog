      <title>Why I stopped using Stack Overflow</title>

      <description>Stack Overflow is great and it saved me many times. I only use it to read and usually do not ask questions and do not contribute. Despite been great for me I had a bad experience dealing with a person. I once asked a question and all that I got was a down vote, which is bad to your &amp;ldquo;points&amp;rdquo; in the community.
The reason is that the question was answered already somewhere in different words and because of this trauma I never asked a question again and any question I ever asked after that has already been answered somehow somewhere in the internet and Google was my best friend for this.</description>

      <description>No one would just plan to have a burn out.
However, there are 2 things you can manage that can reduce drastically the probability of a burnout.
From my own experience and observation burnout happens due to imbalance in two aspects from carrying out job duties.
Doing work that it is at a high level of complexity beyond your level of knowledge and experience. Have an increased volume of work that 8 hours a days is not sufficient to keep up with it.</description>

      <description>Who does not want to spin up an instance of SQL Server Development version?
If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through the pain of downloading and following the installation wizard in windows you can have an instance of SQL server 2022 running on your system in less than 5 min in docker.
I am assuming 2 things you already have installed in your computer.
Docker Desktop WSL SQL server management studio This version runs on a linux container.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I published a post on and shared on LinkedIn and had a quite big reaction as an popular PBI influencer commented on my post.
One of the comments by Jesus Jayaro called my attention saying that if pyodbc is used with execute many it is faster than data factory.
So I did a quick research and in reality it is fast I am impressed.
On my quick research I could put together a working script.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote blog post about how to connect pandas to your SQL database and read file from SQL server.
pandas is a fantastic tool to analyse and manipulate data. I use it all the time. It is very efficient if the &amp;ldquo;size&amp;rdquo; of the data is say up to 1 million records and can be done in your local machine or in a VM fairly quick calculations. No problems at all.</description>

      <description>Sometimes debugging take more time than you are willing to spend on it. Usually you do not want to waste any time debugging but the life of a software developer is debugging all the time.
I came across a interesting one.
I often see mini examples on twitter about a code snippet of how objects behave in Python and some unintended consequences may cause your code to do things you were not expecting, yet it totally makes sense.</description>

      <description>The other day I wanted to connect pandas to Azure SQL DB and boy took me longer than I wanted. In the end I solved my problem. Although, connecting to DBs always involves more complex things like DB drives and OS dependencies the part I struggled the most was with the connection string ðŸ˜…. Microsoft, in its documentation, which by the way is good, gives good example and steps on setting up the environnement and how to connect through pyodbc.</description>

      <description>According to the World Economic Forum Report data scientist is one of the most sought after professional and on the rise in 2020/2021 and it will be for a while.
In 2012 when Harvard Business Review published the article as the most sexy profession it is strange someone saying that does not want to be a data scientist?
Why not if it is so hot and so cool and it pays so much?</description>

      <description>About 2 months ago I considered my self an intermediate python user.
This level of knowledge was enough to work on pandas data transformation and use most of the data science API.
However, when it comes to software engineering and developing production, tested code I realized that there was a lot to learn about programming concepts and how that would work with python.
My intermediate knowledge and experience already gave me lots of power but when I started to dig into source code and also at work when I had to browse to some large code base I felt that I did not know lots of things in python and had to get my s*** together and become a proficient advanced and fluent python user.</description>

      <description>In OOP (Object Oriented Programming) there is a concept called Polymorphism which allow the use of objects of different types through a uniform interface.
Since Python allow OOP constructs Polymorphism applies.
As Python is a dynamic type language a method didnâ€™t using an interface does not need to know about about the interface type, only it&amp;rsquo;s abstract details. The interface will work just by making suer the arguments match when it is used.</description>

      <description>I have to confess that regex is a weakness this is why I am writing this post.
Whenever I can I try to avoid using regex if the problem can be used in a different way, but sometimes I have to inevitably use regex.
to import
import re
This is the only part that I usually remember :)
Regex are patters represented by symbols
for example
pattern = &amp;#39;a&amp;#39; test_string = &amp;#39;a cat&amp;#39; result = re.</description>

      <description>I am a cyclist enthusiast and you may be if you are reading this blog post.
Strava has a nice API which gives access to the data recorded on the application.
Strava does not make it easy for the normal human being that no nothing about coding to access the data, on the other hand it makes it amazing for someone that knows code and is a developer. The API, which stands for Application Programming Interface allows to interact with Strava application and do lots of operations like extract data and also post, if enough permission is given by the user.</description>

      <description>I am learning OpenShift as I am using it more and more at work and it has been great fun and I am really enjoying the DevOps space which is giving me new super powers as a developer.
It is not the intent of this post explain OpenShift but in summary is a RedHat product to manage a Kubernetes cluster. There are some peculiarities of OpenShift but it is pretty much Kubernetes in 98% of cases.</description>

      <description>What business admit that is not driven by data?
Even if some argue that most of the business make decisions on intuition at least some understanding of the data is needed such as how much is in the bank, what is the sales ytd, how many staff there are in the books, are we meeting budget.
No one just make decisions on a whim and in my view to some degree all companies are data driven.</description>

      <description>Using the command line interface (CLI) can be very intimidating and make one completely lost if you always dealt with graphical drag and drop, click and point interface.
I grew up in the 80s and my first interactions with computer was always through CLI and remember that the 2 first commands I learned were then cls for clear the screen and dir to list the files in the current directory. Even applications like word for MS-DOS was all text and there was no mouse then.</description>

      <description>This is the second attempt I started a blog and this time is different.
I once had a blog that was not about data science but I was able to write over 150 blog posts and I had a decent readership and people following it and even launched a paid e-book that gave me some money. Not enough for me to do it full time but it was very encouraging and it kept me motivated to keep me writing.</description>

      <description>Python is a magical language. It is just import from * and then the magic start happening&amp;hellip;
However, not always all run smoothly. Sometimes all that you want is to run code but as part of coding debugging is a constant battle until you get your code running as you wish.
Besides the debugging, you need to set up your development environment that can be very very tedious. Sometime you just want to code and get your job done and you may spend hours and hours just setting up the environnement, importing packages, creating VMs, exporting environment variables, running shell scrips, going 10x to stack overflow and still struggle to make things work fine, then finally you can start writing some code.</description>

      <description>I am Pedro Junqueira Full Stack Business Intelligence Data Analyst Scientist
I have been a data analyst and a business analyst for couple of decades, however have not left excel spreadsheets, until around 2016 where I have been focused more on the Data Science Space, which involve more and more computer science and I rarely solve my clients problem using excel nowadays.
Since I started working on the IT side of data I realized that it is not enough only to know statists, EDA and Machine learning to thrive, because if you really want to solve the data problems that organizations face, the rabbit hole is much deeper.</description>

      <description>If I am not doing an Udemy course, testing a tutorial or doing any online course in any break I get to learn as much as I can about Python, Computer Science, Software Engineering, Statistics and Data Science, I am listening to a podcast. I usually do this when I am commuting either riding my bike, on the bus or driving. A good time to listen to a podcast is when I need a break from absorbing too much content by following a course.</description>
